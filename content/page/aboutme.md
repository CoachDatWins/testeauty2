## About Me 

I am Nivin 15Y/O Web Devaloper and Loves Coding . I do coding in my spare time, and I have collaborated with [Bottom_bar_sheet](https://github.com/Frezyx/bottom_bar_with_sheet) , [GiveMeBadge](https://givemebadge.alexflipnote.dev/) and [HackClubDino](https://github.com/hackclub/dinosaurs). I am looking to collaborate with many open-source projects. In my spare time, I have created many projects, such as an IoT water irrigation system and an IOT water tank alert system, and I have converted non-appliances to smart support by using Alex to turn off and on the appliances. This project was good. I enjoyed it. Later, I started to join [DCSRobotics](https://dcsrobo.com/). Honestly, the experience was good. There were batches So I joined a batch, and that batch was so good. Still, I can't forget the batch. They explained how the robots will work and everything from Scratch to the IDE. Soon I started creating my robot in DCSRobotics, and it was so good.
I forgot to take photosÂ  Since 2021, I have met with [Khaleel](https://github.com/khalby786). He told me everything, like how to make a site and blog from scratch. And that's how I made my own site and blog. Khaleel, big thanks .  :D
