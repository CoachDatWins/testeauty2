## HTML Title and Paragraph 

So lets move into the topic that we are going to study.Title and Paragraph are the most importent element in your site . When you devalop a new site or it may be a blog or a portfoilo site or other site your site needs this element . 

## Code and Jump !

To code a html file open any IDE and create a new file Named as `index.html` . This file tell your webroser that how the site looks and its style . 

Once you created it open the file import html  Declaration by typing `!` on you IDE .Your IDE will genarate the code for html. It looks like this 

<br><br>

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html> - > HTML Tag Open
<body> - > body Tag Open
</body> -> Body tag close
</html> - > HTML Tag Close

```
*Note : `<!DOCTYPE html>` is the  Declaration*

Most of the uses dont know what is declaration . So i am going to answer it 
<br><br>
The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags)


## HTML Headings

HTML headings are defined with the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.
`<h1>` defines the most important heading. `<h6>` defines the least important heading:`

```
<h1>I am Big </h1>
<h6> I am Small</h6>

```


## HTML Paragraph 

HTML paragraphs are defined with the `<p>` tag:
```
<p> Hello I am Github ;D</p>

```

## HTML Links 

HTML links are defined with the `<a>` tag:

```
<a href="https://github.com/Nivin389">This is a link</a>

```
